# Prompt for Lovable: Male Hair Salon Webpage

Create a modern, welcoming landing page for a male-focused hair salon using the following business details:

- **Name:** Salong Hanna
- **Address:** Glömmingegränd 18A, Stockholm, Sweden 163 62
- **Profession:** Hair Stylist (display “Hair Stylist · 9 posts” as a supporting line)
- **Status:** Closed until 10:00 AM (show clear hours or status indicator)
- **Phone:** +46 8 36 24 20 (make it clickable on mobile)

## Design Goals
- Lean into a masculine, refined aesthetic (deep blues/charcoal palette, sharp typography, subtle gradients or metallic accents).
- Hero section with the shop name, status badge, and a clear call-to-action button (e.g., “Book a Cut”).
- Prominent address block with a map/location cue and an easy copy action.
- Services or feature highlights in clean cards; include a short “Why choose us” blurb.
- Section for social proof or gallery preview reflecting “9 posts,” with room for imagery.
- Responsive layout that looks great on desktop and mobile; keep spacing generous and legible.
- Use modern CSS (flex/grid), smooth hover states, and accessible contrast.

## Content Structure
1. **Header/Hero:** Name, specialty line, status badge, CTA.
2. **Contact & Location:** Address with map pin icon, phone link, optional “Get Directions” button.
3. **Hours:** Show current status and opening time (Closed until 10:00 AM) with an hours table if desired.
4. **Services/Highlights:** 3–6 cards describing key offerings.
5. **Gallery/Posts:** Grid or carousel noting “9 posts,” ready for images.
6. **Footer:** Quick contacts, social links, and a compact copyright line.

Keep copy concise and inviting, emphasizing premium grooming for men while staying approachable.
